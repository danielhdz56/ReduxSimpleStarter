//Class based component vs Functional based component

//Functional Based component
    //Used whenever we want to have a simple component that takes some number of properties and returns some number of static jsx
    //lightweight and fast

//Class Based Component
    //Used whenever we want to have the concept of state


//State
    //we set the state inside the constructor
    //whenever we change our state the component instantly re-renders along with any children component that it contains
